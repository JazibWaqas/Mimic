  "text_overlay_intent": "The phrase 'THE DARKNESS | THE NIGHT OF' demands a visual narrative centered on the nocturnal aesthetic, emphasizing the isolation of the driver and the high-contrast battle against the environment. It implies that the race is not just a sporting event, but a psychological confrontation with the night itself.",

The narrative will be anchored by the vehicle, but humanized by the driver's presence in the build and aftermath.",

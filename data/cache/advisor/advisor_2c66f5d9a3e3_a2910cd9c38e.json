  "editorial_strategy": "I will lean into the 'People-Group' anchor to sell the collective nostalgia of the text overlay. Because the library lacks true low-energy clips, I am forcing a 'Long Hold' on the most intimate, static frames available (clip61 and clip75) to create the necessary emotional gravity for the Intro and Outro. The Peak will be a relentless barrage of the highest-intensity group play to mirror the 'fleeting' nature of the narrative.",
  "remake_strategy": "To reach Director's Cut quality, source 3-4 slow-motion, low-energy outdoor shots (e.g., a child running through tall grass at sunset). The current edit is emotionally resonant but visually 'loud' throughout; adding these quiet, nature-based 'breathers' would perfect the rhythmic arc.",

    ]
  },
  "editorial_strategy": "I am prioritizing the 'kinetic' interpretation of the text overlay. Since the library is biased toward high-intensity home videos, the edit will lean into the 'wildness' of being young, using the peak to create a dizzying sense of life before dropping into a quiet, intimate outro to land the emotional 'Oh' of the text.",
  "remake_strategy": "To achieve a true 'Director's Cut,' capture 3-4 low-intensity, observational shots of childhood artifacts (a discarded toy, a sunlit window) and 1-2 slow-motion close-ups of a child's face. This will provide the necessary 'silence' to balance the current library's high-volume energy.",

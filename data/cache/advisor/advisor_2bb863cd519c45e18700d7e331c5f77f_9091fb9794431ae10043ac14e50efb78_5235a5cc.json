  "editorial_strategy": "The edit will pivot from aviation to motorsport, treating the race track as the 'danger zone.' We will prioritize the 'Pilot' (Solo-People) in the build-up to ensure the high-speed racing in the peak feels like a personal stakes-driven narrative rather than a generic sports highlight reel.",
  "remake_strategy": "To achieve a true Director's Cut, integrate air-to-air cinematography or wide-angle desert vistas to break the urban claustrophobia. Adding diegetic sound design—specifically jet engine whines layered over racing engines—would bridge the thematic gap between the text and the visuals.",

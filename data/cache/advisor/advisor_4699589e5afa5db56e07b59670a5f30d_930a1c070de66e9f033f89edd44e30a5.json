      "Lack of 'Golden Hour' lighting in the raw footage requires the 'Warm' color grading and 'Soft Light Leaks' to do the heavy lifting for the nostalgic aesthetic.",
      "Absence of 'Tactile Details' (hands in grass, etc.) means the narrative must rely entirely on human expression rather than environmental texture."
    ]
  },
  "editorial_strategy": "The edit will lean into the 'JOY' of the peak to earn the 'PEACE' of the nostalgia. By framing the high-energy group moments as a precious, fleeting dream, the scarcity of quiet footage becomes a narrative choice—childhood is fast and loud, and we only see it in glimpses once it's gone.",
  "remake_strategy": "To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would shoot slow-motion B-roll of environmental textures (sun-dappled leaves, dust motes, grass) and solitary, quiet moments of children in thought to provide the 'breathable' pacing the reference demands.",

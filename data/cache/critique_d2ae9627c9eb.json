  "overall_score": 9.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system demonstrated exceptional narrative discipline by refusing to let the 'scenic landscape' blueprint dilute the 'People-Group' strategic priority. The story transfer is highly effective, successfully transplanting a high-energy, relentless rhythm into a nostalgic memory reel without falling into the trap of using empty 'wallpaper' shots. While the reliance on 'Detail' shots in the final third suggests a thinning library, the execution remains a masterclass in maintaining a narrative lock through subject consistency.",

    "Wide-angle drone or landscape shots that explicitly include the group to bridge the 'scenic' and 'people' requirements",
    "POV transit footage (car interior) featuring friend interactions to serve as the planned 'breathers'",
    "Candid, medium-shot dialogue or laughter moments to deepen the 'emotional carrier' segments"
  ],
  "technical_fidelity": "The system maintained high technical standards, specifically regarding motion continuity and lighting consistency across 15 segments. The beat alignment logic successfully prioritized narrative subject over raw energy peaks, ensuring the 'Relentless' pace felt purposeful rather than chaotic."

  "overall_score": 8.8,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system demonstrated exceptional discipline in adhering to the 'People-Group' constraint, successfully transplanting the nostalgic rhythm of a memory reel without falling into the trap of overusing generic scenic filler. The edit effectively builds from an emotional intro into a sustained high-energy peak, though it occasionally had to throttle raw kinetic energy to maintain the required focus on the social group. While the narrative cohesion is ironclad, the reliance on 'subject over energy' in the final segments suggests the edit prioritized a clean story wrap-up over a high-impact visual crescendo.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system maintained high technical fidelity by strictly enforcing the 'People-Group' anchor across all 15 segments. Beat alignment and energy progression were logically mapped, with the 'Peak' stage receiving the most emotionally weighted clips. The transition from 'Build-up' to 'Peak' shows a clear understanding of narrative pacing."

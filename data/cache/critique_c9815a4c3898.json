  "overall_score": 8.8,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully prioritized the 'Messy Human' strategy by relentlessly anchoring every cut to group dynamics rather than falling back on safe, aesthetic filler. The story transfer from the nostalgic reference is evident in the deliberate selection of 'Emotional Carriers' during build-up phases, ensuring the rhythm serves the friendship arc rather than just the beat. While the system expertly maintained narrative subject over raw energy, the edit's ultimate impact is slightly capped by a reliance on generic 'Action' shots where more specific, intimate 'Reactions' would have deepened the private-joke atmosphere.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high technical discipline by maintaining lighting and motion continuity across segments while strictly adhering to the 'People-Group' constraint. Energy gating was balanced against narrative weight, ensuring the 'Build-up' and 'High-energy' segments were structurally sound despite library limitations."

  "overall_score": 7.8,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully translated the 'Top Gun' naval aviation energy into a grounded motorsport narrative by obsessively anchoring on the 'Pilot' figure during the build-up. While the strategy to treat the track as a 'danger zone' is evident through the consistent use of solo-subject clips, the narrative tension falters slightly in the Peak where the system was forced to repeat assets and drift into supporting material. The execution demonstrates a high level of technical discipline in maintaining lighting consistency and visual freshness despite a library that clearly struggled to provide enough high-energy 'People-Solo' variety for the climax.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system showed strong adherence to the 'People-Solo' primary anchor and maintained excellent lighting consistency across the edit. The repetition of clip_024 and the drift in the Peak segments (008, 010) indicate a library exhaustion rather than a logic failure, as the system prioritized 'high-energy' requirements over the primary anchor when the library was depleted."

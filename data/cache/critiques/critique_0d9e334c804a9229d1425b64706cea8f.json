  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully captures the kinetic energy of a brotherhood trip, effectively using a 'rhythmic dump' to mask the scarcity of quiet, contemplative moments. While the system leaned heavily on the 'People-Group' anchor to maintain narrative heart, the lack of specific detail shots like 'heart hands' forced a reliance on broader action sequences that occasionally diluted the intimate nostalgia. The result is a high-octane celebration of presence, though it sacrifices some of the requested 'serene' grounding due to the high-energy bias of the available library.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated excellent adherence to the 'Hold Authority Rule' for the intro and maintained a 'Hard Lock' on the People-Group anchor during the Peak. Energy gating was consistent, though the lack of low-energy assets forced a high-energy bias throughout the Build-up."

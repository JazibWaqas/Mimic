  "overall_score": 8.5,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully prioritized the 'Chaos' of human interaction over the sterility of campus architecture, effectively transplanting the reference's high-energy rhythm into a people-centric narrative. While the edit maintains a relentless focus on group dynamics to sell the 'Never Bad' sentiment, there is a visible tension where the system had to sacrifice raw kinetic energy for narrative subject consistency in the 'Detail' and 'Button' segments. The result is a cohesive memory reel that feels intentional, though its peak impact is occasionally throttled by the necessity of anchoring on specific subject types rather than pure visual adrenaline.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high technical fidelity by strictly adhering to the 'No Scenic' rule and maintaining motion continuity across 13 segments. The transition from 'Build-up' to 'Peak' stages shows a sophisticated understanding of energy progression, even when constrained by a limited pool of high-energy group assets."

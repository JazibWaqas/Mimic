  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully translates the 'visceral heart rate monitor' strategy by alternating between high-velocity action and tight emotional reactions. The system effectively used 'Detail' and 'Reaction' shots to ground the 'Aggressive' racing narrative, preventing it from becoming a generic montage of vehicles. While the 'Motion-Carry' intent is evident in the sequencing of action shots, the reliance on 'Preparation' proxies suggests a slight tension between the technical 'Pit' narrative and the available visual assets, though the rhythmic escalation toward the 'Peak' remains intact.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high fidelity to the energy gating and segment-specific demands (Intro/Build-up/Peak). The transition from 'Detail' (Seg 5) to 'Action' (Seg 6) suggests a sophisticated execution of scale escalation despite the noted library constraints regarding technical pit footage."

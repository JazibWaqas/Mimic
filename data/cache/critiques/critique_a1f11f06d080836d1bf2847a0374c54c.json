  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully translated the high-stakes 'Top Gun' ethos into a terrestrial racing context by prioritizing the human driver as the emotional anchor. The narrative arc moves effectively from individual focus to high-octane peak action, though the lack of aerial assets forced a heavy reliance on car-to-car dynamics to simulate the dogfight experience. While the late-Peak sequence drifts slightly from the 'People-Solo' anchor due to library limitations, the technical execution maintains a triumphant, cinematic momentum that honors the source material's spirit.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high adherence to the 'People-Solo' anchor strategy in the first half of the edit. Beat alignment and energy progression were executed cleanly, with the system making logical compromises in the Peak stage when primary anchor material was likely exhausted."

  "overall_score": 7.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully anchored the narrative on the 'People-Group' subject, effectively translating the 'Memory Reel' intent into a cohesive visual sequence. The early progression from establishment to reaction shows a sophisticated understanding of story-building, though the system clearly struggled with library exhaustion in the final third, leading to significant clip repetition. While the technical energy gating remains high, the thematic impact is slightly diluted by the mid-sequence drift into 'Detail' and 'Establish' shots that lack the primary human subject requested by the strategy.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated excellent adherence to the 'People-Group' hard lock where assets allowed and maintained consistent lighting and energy ramps. The rhythmic alignment is logically sound, though the repetition of clips in the Peak stage indicates a library constraint rather than a logic failure."

  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully engineered a high-tension dialogue between man and machine, strictly adhering to the 'People-Solo' anchor to sell the pilot's perspective. The narrative transfer from the 'Triumphant' blueprint is palpable, particularly in how the build-up segments leverage intense facial focus to earn the subsequent high-speed action. While the edit maintains a relentless kinetic energy, the lack of low-energy transitional material forces a somewhat breathless conclusion that misses a true emotional 'landing.'",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated excellent deterministic logic by prioritizing narrative continuity (People-Solo) over raw energy in key segments like Seg 4 and Seg 12. The alignment of 'Action' and 'Reaction' shots in the mid-section suggests a sophisticated understanding of rhythmic storytelling, even when forced to drift from the primary anchor due to library limitations."

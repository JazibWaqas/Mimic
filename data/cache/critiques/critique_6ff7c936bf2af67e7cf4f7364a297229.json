  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully leans into the 'People-Group' anchor to deliver a high-octane celebration of friendship, though it struggles to find the quiet, nostalgic breath required for a true memory reel. The system masterfully navigated a library deficit of static shots by using motion-heavy nature pans to bookend the experience, effectively substituting 'stillness' with 'scale.' While the peak is dense and emotionally resonant, the overall narrative feels more like a highlight sizzle than a reflective journey due to the persistent high-energy demands of the available footage.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high technical precision in maintaining the 'People-Group' hard lock across the majority of the edit. Energy gating was consistent, and the transition from 'Adventure' to 'Intimate' motifs within the Peak shows sophisticated semantic layering despite the lack of diverse clip speeds."

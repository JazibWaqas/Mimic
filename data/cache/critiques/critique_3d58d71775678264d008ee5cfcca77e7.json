  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully bridges the gap between the pilot's internal intensity and the external power of the aircraft, maintaining the 'People-Solo' anchor through the majority of the high-octane build. The system effectively navigated the lack of grounding footage by doubling down on 'Action' and 'Reaction' pairings, though the narrative momentum occasionally stutters where the library forced a drift from the human element into pure mechanical action. While the 'Triumphant' energy is relentless, the final release feels slightly over-cranked due to the absence of true low-energy transitional material to provide a necessary emotional exhale.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high adherence to the 'People-Solo' anchor and the 'Action-Completion' motif. Energy gating was consistent, and the teal-orange color grade intent was supported by the selection of high-contrast desert/sea clips. The drift in Segments 6 and 14 is noted as a library-driven compromise rather than a logic failure."

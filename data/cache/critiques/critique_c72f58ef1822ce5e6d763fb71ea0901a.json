  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully translated the 'Relentless' strategy into a cohesive visual arc, effectively using 'People-Solo' anchors to humanize the high-octane racing environment. The edit excels at establishing emotional stakes in the Intro and Build-up, though it understandably sacrifices narrative anchoring for raw kinetic energy during the Peak phase. While the transition from Intro to Build-up remains structurally abrupt due to the known lack of medium-energy bridge material, the technical execution maintains a premium cinematic texture throughout.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high fidelity to the 'People-Solo' constraint in the first half of the edit. The drift into 'Action' and 'Detail' shots in the Peak appears to be a calculated trade-off to satisfy the 'Relentless' energy requirement given the library's limitations. Beat alignment and lighting consistency were maintained across all 20 segments."

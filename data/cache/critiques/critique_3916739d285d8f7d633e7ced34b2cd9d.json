  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully weaponized the 'Man in the Machine' philosophy by aggressively anchoring the narrative on the pilot's perspective, creating a grounded emotional core for an otherwise high-octane subject. While the 'Triumphant' arc is clearly visible through the energy escalation in the Peak stage, the Build-up phase relies perhaps too heavily on repetitive 'People-Solo' motifs, likely due to the identified lack of ground-crew variety. The edit effectively transplants the cinematic intent into a human-centric story, though it occasionally sacrifices raw kinetic momentum to maintain its strict adherence to the 'People-Solo' narrative anchor.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high technical fidelity by strictly adhering to the 'People-Solo' anchor across all stages. Rhythmic alignment is inferred as successful given the strategic placement of 'High-energy' clips at the Peak and Intro, though the Build-up's reliance on subject-matching over energy-matching suggests a library-constrained compromise rather than a logic failure."

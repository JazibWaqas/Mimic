  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully engineered a high-octane cadence that mirrors the 'Triumphant' intent of elite naval aviation. The rhythmic interplay between 'Action' and 'Reaction' shots effectively transfers the feeling of duty and speed, though the narrative momentum stutters slightly in the final act due to asset repetition. The system maximized the available library to maintain lighting consistency, even when forced to reuse key frames to satisfy the 'Release' requirements.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system maintained strict adherence to the Action-Reaction-Action loop, ensuring a professional montage flow. Lighting consistency was prioritized across 17 segments, resulting in a cohesive visual grade despite the library limitations that forced clip reuse in the final segments."

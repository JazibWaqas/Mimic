  "overall_score": 8.5,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully transplants the 'Pilot-to-Plane' pipeline by strictly adhering to the 'People-Solo' anchor, effectively humanizing the high-octane naval theme. The system navigated the lack of medium-energy transition material by leaning into an aggressive, high-energy cadence that maintains the 'Triumphant' intent, even when the library forced minor narrative drifts. While the execution is technically precise, the thematic resonance is occasionally strained in the later segments where the system had to prioritize sequence flow over the primary character anchor.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated exceptional adherence to the 'People-Solo' constraint, maintaining narrative continuity across 80% of the edit. The 'Pilot-to-Plane' strategic progression was logically mapped, and the system correctly prioritized narrative subject over raw energy in Segments 5 and 6 to preserve story coherence despite library limitations."

  "overall_score": 7.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully translated a 'Dynamic' intent into a high-cadence visual sequence, prioritizing aesthetic continuity through lighting and freshness. While the rhythmic pulse is evident in the multi-clip segments, the 'Story Transfer' remains surface-level due to the absence of a specific narrative anchor, resulting in a montage that looks professional but lacks a thematic 'hook.' The execution proves the system can maintain a consistent look, but the soul of the edit is currently limited by the generic nature of the source material's metadata and the lack of strategic guidance.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The engine demonstrated high adherence to energy gating, specifically using double-clip segments (8, 13, 15) to create rhythmic peaks. Lighting consistency was maintained throughout, showing strong deterministic control over visual flow despite the lack of strategic constraints."

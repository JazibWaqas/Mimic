  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully anchors the 'People-Group' narrative, maintaining a consistent focus on the human element of the mountain trip as requested. The system effectively transitioned into a sustained 'Peak' sequence by stacking high-energy emotional carriers, though it hit a narrative plateau in the middle where 'Detail' and 'Establish' shots were forced in to maintain visual freshness. While the rhythmic execution is tight, the edit highlights a clear struggle to bridge the travel narrative due to the known scarcity of vehicle-based motion shots, resulting in a story that feels more like a destination gallery than a journey.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high fidelity to the 'People-Group' hard lock, maintaining subject consistency across 75% of the edit. Energy gating was respected, particularly during the Peak stage (Seg 10-15), though the mid-section (Seg 6-8) shows a necessary compromise in narrative subject to avoid visual repetition."

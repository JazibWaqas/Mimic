  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully anchors the 'People-Group' motif to create a cohesive sense of collective memory, though it leans heavily on subject consistency over kinetic variety. The system effectively mirrors the 'fleeting' narrative by increasing clip density through the build-up, even when the library seemingly lacked the raw energy to match the rhythmic peak perfectly. While the narrative coherence is high, the emotional gravity is somewhat limited by the repetition of group shots where more intimate, static anchors were intended for the bookends. Ultimately, the edit achieves a professional 'Story Transfer' by prioritizing the human element of the blueprint over generic aesthetic fillers.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated excellent constraint-handling by maintaining the 'People-Group' anchor throughout, ensuring the narrative message wasn't lost to generic b-roll. The rhythmic progression from the Intro to the Build-up is logically structured, though the Peak's impact is limited by the available high-energy assets."

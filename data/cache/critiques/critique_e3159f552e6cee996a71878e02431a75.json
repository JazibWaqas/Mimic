  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully translates the 'Relentless' strategy into a mechanical, rhythmic progression that mirrors the high-stakes tension of a race weekend. The system effectively balanced the 'Object-Vehicle' dominance with 'Reaction' shots to ground the intensity, though the middle build-up relies heavily on repetitive 'Action' tags which may risk visual fatigue without more 'Technical' interruptions. While the lack of fire footage forced the 'Peak' to rely entirely on the crash narrative, the execution feels intentional and forward-moving, successfully mimicking the 'gear-shift' pacing requested in the blueprint.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high technical discipline, maintaining lighting consistency and visual freshness across a 20-segment edit. The rhythmic alignment with the 'Relentless' pacing was achieved through strategic placement of 'Reaction' and 'Technical' anchors, despite the limited variety in the 'Peak' material."

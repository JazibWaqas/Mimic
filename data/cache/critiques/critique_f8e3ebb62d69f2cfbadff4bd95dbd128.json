  "overall_score": 7.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully translated a 'Dynamic' intent into a high-cadence visual sequence, particularly through the rhythmic density seen in the multi-clip clusters of segments 6, 8, and 13. While the engine prioritized lighting consistency and visual freshness to maintain a professional sheen, the absence of strategic guidance resulted in a 'General' aesthetic that prioritizes technical flow over thematic depth. The execution is technically sound, but the repetitive reliance on 'freshness' suggests the system was working hard to mask a lack of specific narrative anchors in the source library.",

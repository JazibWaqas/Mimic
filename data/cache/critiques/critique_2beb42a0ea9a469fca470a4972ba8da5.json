  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully translates the high-octane pressure of Formula 1 by anchoring the narrative in intense emotional carriers and rapid-fire action sequences. The system effectively navigated the lack of explicit wealth symbols by leaning into the 'Action' and 'Intense' tags to maintain the relentless pace required by the blueprint. While the rhythmic progression from build-up to peak is technically sound, the reliance on repeated assets in the finale highlights a library constraint rather than a failure in logic, though it slightly dampens the 'Peak' impact.",

  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully prioritized the 'Brotherhood' narrative by maintaining a disciplined 'People-Group' anchor throughout the edit, even when the library's energy levels fluctuated. The story transfer effectively moves from adventurous anticipation into a high-octane peak, though the scarcity of scenic mountain assets forced the system to rely heavily on group shots to carry the 'Adventure' theme. While the rhythmic intent is clear, the inclusion of 'Reflective' and 'Peaceful' clips in high-energy segments suggests a library limitation where the system chose thematic consistency over raw kinetic energy.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high fidelity to the 'Hard Lock' constraint on People-Group subjects. Rhythmic alignment appears consistent with the 120 BPM default, and the transition from Build-up to Peak atmospheres (Ecstatic/Joyful) was logically mapped despite limited high-energy source material."

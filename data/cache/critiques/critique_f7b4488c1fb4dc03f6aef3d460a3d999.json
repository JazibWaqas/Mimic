  "overall_score": 8.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the edit successfully captures the 'Human in the Machine' ethos by anchoring the high-octane aviation footage in the stoic, solo presence of the pilots. The system effectively navigated the library's limitations, using the 'People-Solo' anchor to ground the kinetic energy of the jets, though the lack of indoor environments forced a heavy reliance on the flight deck for the narrative's quiet moments. While the transition into the action-heavy mid-section is seamless, the narrative weight occasionally thins when the system is forced to drift from its human anchor to maintain the high-energy rhythm required for a triumphant music video.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The system demonstrated high technical precision in maintaining lighting consistency and visual freshness across 17 segments. Energy gating was strictly followed, and the prioritization of narrative continuity over raw energy in the early segments successfully built the 'earned' adrenaline requested in the strategy."

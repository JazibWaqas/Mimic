  "overall_score": 9.2,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system demonstrated exceptional narrative discipline by strictly adhering to the 'human-locked' constraint, ensuring that the 'companions over locations' message remained the focal point. The edit successfully transitions from static group anchors into a high-energy rhythmic peak, effectively transplanting the nostalgic memory-reel vibe through a logical progression of 'Action' and 'Reaction' shots. While the system relied on 'Detail' and 'Action' fillers to maintain the energy curve in the final act, the core emotional resonance was successfully carried by the group-centric selections rather than falling back on generic scenic b-roll.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The execution shows perfect adherence to the 'People-Group' tag requirements. The system correctly identified and prioritized 'Emotional Carriers' for the peak energy segments (Seg 8-12) while maintaining lighting and motion continuity across a rapid-fire sequence of 15 clips."

    "body": "We are hitting a bottleneck with missing payoff shots and specific motifs like 'intensity' and 'action.' I had to use structural anchors to keep the pacing from collapsing, which means we have a cool, syncopated flow that occasionally lacks the emotional punch I wanted to deliver. The edit is technically sound but limited by the available assets."

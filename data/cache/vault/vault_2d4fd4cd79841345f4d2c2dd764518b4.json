We are missing medium-energy transitions and high-impact payoffs, which meant I had to use structural anchors like clip_015.mp4 and clip_022.mp4 to prevent the edit from feeling like a random sequence of filler. The cool tone is consistent, but the emotional impact is limited by the available footage."

  "executive_summary": [
    "The edit relies on a warm tone to maintain a nostalgic feel despite a lack of visual variety.",
    "Library scarcity in medium and low energy clips forced a reliance on filler content to maintain the timeline.",
    "The absence of payoff shots prevented the 'joy' segment from reaching a traditional emotional peak.",
    "Rhythmic soul was preserved by prioritizing pacing over the missing ideal motifs.",
    "All clip selections were driven by library gaps rather than optimal narrative alignment.",
    "The technical score of 8.0 reflects strong sync fidelity despite the library's content bottlenecks."

    "hero": "The library's lack of energy variety and missing payoff shots turned what should have been a celebration into a quiet, reflective loop.",
    "body": "I leaned into a warm tone and breathable pacing because the library lacked the 'payoff' shots needed for a traditional climax. With scarcity in both medium and low energy clips, I had to optimize for flow rather than impact. The resulting edit is technically sound but emotionally capped by the available footage."

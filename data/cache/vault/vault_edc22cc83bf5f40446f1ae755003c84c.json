While the clips are technically aligned, the lack of 'intensity' and 'action' motifs forced me to use structural anchors that keep the rhythm but sacrifice the intended punch. You're seeing clips like 002 and 004 repeat because the library didn't provide enough variety to sustain 17 segments without recycling."

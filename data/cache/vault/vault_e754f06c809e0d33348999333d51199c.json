    "body": "We hit a hard bottleneck with energy levels; the library is thin on medium and low energy clips, which makes the 'breathable' pacing feel more like a necessity than a choice. Without specific payoff motifs, I had to lean on the available clips to keep the story moving without a traditional climax. The system optimized for what was there, but the library didn't provide the 'wow' moments needed for a true narrative payoff."

    "body": "We hit a major bottleneck with energy levels. Because the library lacked medium-energy clips, the pacing feels breathable but lacks the necessary 'climb' to a resolution. I used a 35mm grain overlay to mask the visual inconsistencies, but the structural gaps in the footage—specifically the missing wide shots—mean the edit stays small when it should feel big."

  "executive_summary": [
    "The edit prioritizes a warm tone and breathable pacing over high-energy transitions.",
    "Library scarcity in medium and low energy clips forced a reliance on available filler footage.",
    "Missing payoff shots required a strategic focus on rhythmic consistency to prevent a pacing collapse.",
    "All thirteen clips were selected because no better alternatives existed in the current library.",
    "The final cut preserves the nostalgic soul by accepting narrative tradeoffs in the celebration segments."

    "hero": "This edit is a masterclass in making do with a thin deck; the library's lack of energy and payoff shots turned a potential celebration into a quiet, reflective sit-down.",
    "body": "We hit a hard ceiling with the available footage. The library is missing the 'payoff' moments needed to bridge the gap between segments, so I leaned into warm tones and breathable pacing to keep the structure from collapsing. Every choice was a tradeoff to keep the rhythm alive while the library's scarcity of low and medium energy clips limited our emotional range."

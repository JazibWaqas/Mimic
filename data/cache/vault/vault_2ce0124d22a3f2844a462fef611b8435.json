    "body": "We hit a significant bottleneck with 'scarcity_medium_energy' and a total lack of payoff shots. This forced the deployment of structural anchors in segments like 7 and 14 just to keep the timeline moving. While the cool tone remains consistent, the edit is carrying the weight that the footage should have handled."

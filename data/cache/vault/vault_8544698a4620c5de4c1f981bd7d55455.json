Because the library was 'limited,' I had to use structural anchors like clip_015 and clip_019 to hold the timeline together, even though they likely didn't match the 'adventure' vibe I was looking for. The technical score remains high because the sync is tight, but the emotional impact is capped by the footage scarcity."

    "hero": "The library didn't have the teeth for a high-energy edit, so I pivoted to a quiet, warm reflection.",
    "body": "Scarcity of wide shots and payoff moments created a bottleneck that prevented a traditional narrative arc. I optimized for a breathable pace to ensure the nostalgic tone felt intentional rather than accidental. The technical score of 8.0 reflects a solid assembly that was ultimately capped by the available footage."

    "body": "We hit a bottleneck with 'missing_payoff_shots,' which meant I had to lean on pacing and vibrant tones to mask the lack of a true climax. I used structural anchors in key spots like Segment 5 and 12 to hold the frame together, even when the library lacked the action motifs needed to really sell the intent. The technical sync is nominal, but the narrative is working overtime to compensate for the library's gaps."

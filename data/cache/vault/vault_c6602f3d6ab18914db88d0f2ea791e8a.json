    "body": "We hit a major bottleneck with missing payoff shots, which forced me to lean on the edit's rhythm to mask the lack of visual punch. While the cool tone provides a professional sheen, the absence of 'human_detail' motifs makes the connection feel distant. To fix this, we need high-intensity action and close-up human elements to replace the structural fillers currently holding the timeline together."

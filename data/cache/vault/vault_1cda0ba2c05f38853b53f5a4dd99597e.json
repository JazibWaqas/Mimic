    "A scarcity of medium and low-energy clips forced a reliance on available library assets.",
    "I prioritized rhythmic consistency because the library lacked the requested payoff motifs.",

    "hero": "The library is starving for energy; I had to build a house out of bricks because there wasn't any marble available.",
    "body": "We are facing a significant bottleneck with 'scarcity_medium_energy' and 'scarcity_low_energy' tags. Without payoff shots, the edit leans heavily on reflective pacing to hide the lack of a traditional climax. The technical score of 8.0 reflects a successful assembly under these constraints, but the emotional ceiling is capped by the footage provided."

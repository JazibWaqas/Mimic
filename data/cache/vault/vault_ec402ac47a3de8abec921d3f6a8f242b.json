    "hero": "The library is starving for energy; I had to lean on reflective pacing because the payoff shots simply aren't there.",
    "body": "We hit a bottleneck with medium and low energy clips, which limited the dynamic range of the 'nostalgic_rhythms' reference. Without specific payoff motifs, the edit functions as a steady, warm-toned sequence rather than a build-up to a climax. Every choice was a tradeoff to keep the rhythm alive despite the thin library."

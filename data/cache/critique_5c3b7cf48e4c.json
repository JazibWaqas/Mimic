  "overall_score": 8.8,
  "monologue": "Based on the observed segments, the system successfully transplanted the reference's high-energy rhythm into a human-centric narrative, strictly adhering to the 'People-Group' priority. The edit demonstrates a sophisticated arc, moving from dense group action in the early segments to a deliberate emotional 'Release' during the peak, ensuring the mountain setting never overshadowed the friendship. While the system relied on 'emotional carriers' to bridge the build-up, the consistent return to group-anchored shots preserved the soul-cleansing intent of the original blueprint.",

  "technical_fidelity": "The execution shows exceptional narrative discipline. The system maintained motion continuity and lighting consistency across 15 clips, successfully mapping 'Action' shots to high-energy segments and 'Release' shots to the narrative peak without violating the 'People-Group' constraint."

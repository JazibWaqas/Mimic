{
  "text_overlay_intent": "The text 'Life when that one friend group is together>>' demands a high-energy, socially dense celebration of collective identity. It requires moments of chaotic joy, shared laughter, and uninhibited group movement that prove life is qualitatively better when these specific people are united.",
  "dominant_narrative": "A high-octane tribute to the irreplaceable bond and shared adventures of a close-knit friend group, emphasizing that their presence transforms ordinary moments into legendary memories.",

    "Intro": {
      "primary_emotional_carrier": "Immediate group arrival and shared movement.",

      "intent_diluting_material": "Empty landscapes, static establishing shots, or solo subjects without immediate group payoff.",
      "reasoning": "The intro must instantly validate the text overlay by showing the group in motion. We are not setting a scene; we are launching an experience.",

      "intent_diluting_material": "Passive observation, slow-motion solo shots, or generic travel b-roll like airplane wings.",
      "reasoning": "The build-up needs to transition from 'being together' to 'doing together.' The energy must climb through shared physical stakes.",

      "intent_diluting_material": "Any shot where the group is not the central focus or where the energy dips below a 'peak' threshold.",
      "reasoning": "This is the core of the 'Life when...' promise. These clips must feel like the 'best-of' highlights that the group will talk about for years.",

      "intent_diluting_material": "Abrupt endings, lonely solo shots, or purely scenic sunsets without human presence.",
      "reasoning": "The outro should feel like a 'button' on a great day. It needs to maintain the group connection while allowing the energy to settle into a nostalgic memory.",

  "editorial_strategy": "Prioritize 'People-Group' clips with 'High' energy and 'Dynamic' motion. The text overlay is a promise of social chaos and joy; therefore, any clip without at least two people interacting should be deprioritized. Car-based singing and group laughter are the 'hero' moments of this edit. Scenic shots are only permitted if they feature the group (e.g., the motorboat or the snowy mountain walk) to maintain the narrative anchor.",

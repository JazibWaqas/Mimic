I want to use multiple moments from the clips starting with a buildup so hold on a scence till the music builds up showing how carefree and happy i used to be,its not a sad reel its a joyous reel which is meant to celebrate life its vibrant its heartwarming, as the music picks up we start going through more scences we dont want to be too fast paced but beggining we want to keep it building up slightly slower and then near the end as the music really builds and then slows we want to turn fast faced signifying how fast time moved away from us and that chapter of our life is over.As the music softens, we end on a quiet, glowing frame."

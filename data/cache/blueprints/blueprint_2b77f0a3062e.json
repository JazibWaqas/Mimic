  "text_prompt": "# THE MAIN CHARACTER CUT: A CHILDHOOD ODYSSEY\n\n**Editorial Philosophy:**\nSynthesize a cinematic masterpiece that proves these clips aren't just footage\u2014they are a family's legacy. This edit must feel like the \"Main Character\" moment of a life well-lived. Prioritize \"Soul\" and \"Emotional Rawness\" over technical polish.\n\n**Narrative Arc:**\n1. **The Invitation (Intro):** Start with a slow, wide-angle observation of childhood. Focus on the 'Purest Innocence'\u2014let the viewer settle into the warmth of the light.\n2. **The Spark of Connection (Build-up):** Transition into shared, ground-level magic. We want to see children rolling in laughter, literally down on their level\u2014capture the tactile joy of the carpet and the floor. (Note: Targets clip 81 perfectly).\n3. **The Kinetic Soul (The Peak):** Explode into raw, high-vibrancy energy. I want to see the \"Unfiltered Scream of Joy\"\u2014even if the camera is moving or the moments are chaotic, the energy must be undeniable. This is the peak of childhood vitality. (Note: Targets clip 102's unique energy).\n4. **The Anchor of Attachment (The Outro):** Conclude with the ultimate emotional anchor. A single, intimate embrace that defines childhood love. This final shot MUST be a long, uninterrupted hold that lets the hug breathe until the very last frame. Treat this as the \"Final Exhale\" of the memory. (Note: Targets clip 95's reflection moment).\n\n**Tactical Intelligence Rules:**\n- **Pacing:** Sparse CDE for the Intro/Outro (Long Breaths). Dense CDE for the Peak.\n- **Text Overlay (Subtle/Elegant):** \"We didn't know we were making memories. We just knew we were having fun.\"\n- **Vibe Bridge:** Prioritize 'Intimacy' and 'Pure Affection' as the strongest signals.\n- **Visuals:** Warm tones. Film grain. Make it feel like 35mm film found in an attic.\n\n**Overall Feeling:** \nSmiling through tears. Precious. Profoundly human. A reminder that everyone is the main character of their own story.",

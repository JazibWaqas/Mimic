    "strengths": [
      "Abundant high-energy group footage for the Peak",

  "overall_strategy": "Since the library contains modern young-adult footage rather than childhood videos, the edit will pivot to 'modern nostalgia.' We will use the hazy, atmospheric scenic shots to bridge the gap and focus heavily on candid, high-energy group interactions to replicate the emotional weight of the reference's play-centric narrative.",

  🧠 Calling Gemini for strategic guidance...
[OK] Using Gemini 3 model: gemini-3-flash-preview
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text 'NERVES | MY | LOVE | A MAN | WHAT A | RPM' implies a deeply personal, almost obsessive connection between the driver's psyche and the machine. It demands a juxtaposition of internal human tension and external mechanical violence.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The symbiotic and high-stakes relationship between a driver's psychological focus and the visceral, dangerous reality of professional racing.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit must prioritize the human element ('The Man') as the anchor for the mechanical speed. By framing the racing action as a psychological extension of the driver's 'Nerves' and 'Love', the system will avoid a generic sports montage and instead deliver a visceral, narrative-driven experience.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage (ACTION)
      - Strong technical and mechanical details (INTENSITY)
      - High-quality cinematic assets for the peak (Crashes/Fireworks)

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarcity of Medium/Low energy clips requires using high-intensity shots with tighter framing to simulate the 'Intro' tension.
      - Limited 'Fire' imagery is compensated for by using high-impact crash sequences and fireworks.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of specific 'Close-ups of driver focus' outside of cockpit shots; will rely on training montages to represent the 'Man'.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit must prioritize the human element ('The Man') as the anchor for the mechanical speed. By framing the racing action as a psychological extension of the driver's 'Nerves' and 'Love', the system will avoid a generic sports montage and instead deliver a visceral, narrative-driven experience.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, additional macro-photography of driver sweat, eyes behind visors, and actual engine-block fire should be integrated to heighten the 'visceral' and 'high-stakes' requirements.

  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text functions as rhythmic, percussive punctuation that bridges corporate identity with raw human emotion, demanding a staccato editing style where visual cuts synchronize with the 'Flash-on' delivery.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The relentless psychological and physical pressure of elite motorsport, where technical precision meets chaotic danger.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit must prioritize 'Relentless' pacing by favoring clips with forward-moving dynamic motion. Every cut should feel like a gear shift, using the 'Flash-on' text as the metronome for the entire sequence. We will lean into the 'Filmic Commercial' look by pairing high-contrast racing shots with the gritty, high-stakes crash footage to ensure the 'Aggressive' intent is never lost.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-intensity racing footage
      - Specific crash and fire sequences (clip71, clip72) perfectly match the 'Must-Have' criteria
      - Strong selection of technical and pit-lane details

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The scarcity of Low/Medium energy clips requires using 'Preparation' high-energy clips as the Intro to avoid a flat energy profile.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Limited 'Slow motion' specific tags in metadata, though 'Dynamic' motion suggests speed-ramp potential.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit must prioritize 'Relentless' pacing by favoring clips with forward-moving dynamic motion. Every cut should feel like a gear shift, using the 'Flash-on' text as the metronome for the entire sequence. We will lean into the 'Filmic Commercial' look by pairing high-contrast racing shots with the gritty, high-stakes crash footage to ensure the 'Aggressive' intent is never lost.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):

================================================================================
💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage (Object-Vehicle) perfectly matches the 'Relentless' pacing.
      - Specific high-stakes crash footage (clip71, clip72) provides the necessary narrative peak.
      - Strong selection of preparation and technical shots (clip52, clip74) for the intro/build.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The scarcity of 'Medium' energy clips means the build-up will likely be more aggressive than the reference, skipping the gradual ramp for a sustained high-intensity plateau.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of specific 'fire' footage mentioned in the Must-Have content; the crash footage will have to carry the weight of the high-stakes peak alone.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit must prioritize the 'Relentless' pacing by using the text overlays as rhythmic anchors. Every cut should feel like a gear shift—intentional, mechanical, and forward-moving. We will lean heavily into the 'Object-Vehicle' subject to maintain the commercial-filmic look, using 'People-Solo' only to ground the stakes in human nerves.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate macro-photography of engine vibrations and extreme close-ups of the driver's pupils dilating. This would bridge the gap between the mechanical 'RPM' and the psychological 'NERVES' mentioned in the text.

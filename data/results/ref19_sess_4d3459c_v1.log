  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text functions as a percussive, staccato internal monologue of a driver under extreme pressure, where brand identity and physiological sensation blur. It demands high-contrast, rhythmic visual hits that synchronize with the 'Flash-on' animation to create a sense of sensory overload.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The psychological and physical redline of elite motorsport, where human focus and mechanical violence collide.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit must function as a visual heart rate monitor. We will use the 'Object-Vehicle' as the primary vessel for speed, but anchor the emotional stakes in the 'People-Solo' (Driver) preparation and reaction. The 'Relentless' pace is achieved not just through fast cuts, but through 'Motion-Carry' continuity where the direction of the car's travel dictates the flow of the next shot, creating an unbroken chain of kinetic energy leading to the crash.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage (Object-Vehicle) perfectly matches the 'Relentless' pacing requirement.
      - Specific high-stakes content (crashes in clip71 and 72) provides the necessary narrative peak.
      - Strong 'Intro' material with Brad Pitt and wind tunnel testing establishes the 'A MAN' and 'APXGP' text themes.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarcity of 'Medium' energy clips requires using high-energy clips with more 'Detail' focus to simulate a build-up without exhausting the viewer too early.
      - The 'Outro' will rely on victory celebrations (clip70) rather than 'lifestyle' shots to maintain the racing-centric authority.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Limited 'Pit stop' specific technical details; will need to use 'Strategy meeting' and 'Pit lane preparation' (clip69) as proxies for technical precision.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit must function as a visual heart rate monitor. We will use the 'Object-Vehicle' as the primary vessel for speed, but anchor the emotional stakes in the 'People-Solo' (Driver) preparation and reaction. The 'Relentless' pace is achieved not just through fast cuts, but through 'Motion-Carry' continuity where the direction of the car's travel dictates the flow of the next shot, creating an unbroken chain of kinetic energy leading to the crash.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, additional macro-cinematography of driver physiology (sweat, eyes, heart rate) and extreme slow-motion 'phantom' footage of carbon fiber shattering during the crash would deepen the 'Visceral' intent. More explicit 'Pit Stop' choreography would also strengthen the 'Technical Detail' requirement.

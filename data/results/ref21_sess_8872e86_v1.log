  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The phrase 'THE DARKNESS | THE NIGHT OF' demands a visual narrative centered on the nocturnal aesthetic, emphasizing the isolation of the driver and the high-contrast battle against the environment. It implies that the race is not just a sporting event, but a psychological confrontation with the night itself.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A high-octane exploration of the dangerous intersection between human precision and mechanical power under the unforgiving lights of a night race.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will prioritize the 'INTENSITY' of the night race by leveraging the high-contrast, high-energy racing clips. We will use the technical 'Build' clips to create a sense of inevitable momentum, leading into a 'Peak' that emphasizes the danger of the sport through crashes and onboard footage. The narrative will be anchored by the vehicle, but humanized by the driver's presence in the build and aftermath.

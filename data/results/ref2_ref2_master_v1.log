💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundance of high-energy 'People-Group' footage (car singing, laughing in rooms, group activities).
      - Strong candid quality that fits the 'trip dump' aesthetic.
      - Excellent variety of 'Peak' intensity moments.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The reference calls for 'scenic nature' peaks, but the library's strongest energy is in urban/indoor settings. I have prioritized the 'besties' energy over the 'nature' setting to preserve narrative intent.
      - Some nature shots are low-energy/static, making them better suited for transitions than story anchors.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of high-intensity nature-based group activities (e.g., group at a campfire or summit).
      - Limited 'cozy' indoor group moments that aren't high-chaos.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   Prioritize the 'Besties' text overlay as the primary narrative driver. The human connection is the story; the travel is the backdrop. Use the high-energy car and hotel clips to anchor the Peak, even if they deviate from the 'nature' theme of the reference, as they better fulfill the user's explicit 'besties' intent.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To reach Director's Cut quality, capture high-energy group interactions specifically in scenic outdoor locations. The current edit relies on indoor/car footage for emotional peaks because the available nature footage is too passive.

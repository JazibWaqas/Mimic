  🧠 Calling Gemini for strategic guidance...
[OK] Using Gemini 3 model: gemini-3-flash-preview
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a psychological profile of high-performance pressure; it frames the machine's 'RPM' as the character's heartbeat and 'NERVES' as the price of 'LOVE' for the sport.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The symbiotic and visceral relationship between a high-stakes pilot and the mechanical violence of their craft.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will treat the jet cockpit as the 'driver's seat,' using tight internal shots to establish 'NERVES' and wide external kinetic shots to satisfy 'RPM.' We will prioritize the 'Filmic Commercial' look by favoring golden hour and high-contrast silhouettes, ensuring the human element (the pilot) remains the emotional anchor amidst the mechanical chaos.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundance of high-energy aviation footage perfectly matches the 'Relentless' pacing requirement.
      - Excellent 'Peak' material with explosions and high-speed maneuvers.
      - Strong 'People-Solo' assets to anchor the 'A MAN' narrative.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Aviation assets must stand in for 'Racing' assets; the editorial intent pivots from track-racing to air-racing/combat.
      - Limited 'Medium' energy clips mean the build-up must rely on shorter cuts of 'High' energy clips to simulate a ramp.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of literal 'fire imagery' outside of the dogfight explosion; afterburners will be used as the primary visual surrogate for 'fire'.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will treat the jet cockpit as the 'driver's seat,' using tight internal shots to establish 'NERVES' and wide external kinetic shots to satisfy 'RPM.' We will prioritize the 'Filmic Commercial' look by favoring golden hour and high-contrast silhouettes, ensuring the human element (the pilot) remains the emotional anchor amidst the mechanical chaos.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate macro-photography of vibrating cockpit needles and extreme close-ups of a pilot's dilating pupils. Adding literal asphalt-level racing textures would bridge the gap between the 'Racing' text and the 'Aviation' visuals.

  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text 'if life doesnt kill me, nostalgia will' implies that the past is a heavy, visceral force. It demands footage that feels like a 'flood' of memories—moments so vivid and joyful they become painful to look back on.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A bittersweet immersion into the chaotic joy of childhood, framed as an overwhelming sensory weight that the narrator carries into adulthood.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will lean into the 'overwhelming' nature of the text by creating a dense, high-energy barrage of childhood memories. By treating these joyful clips with heavy vintage effects and slow-motion, we transform 'happy' footage into 'haunting' memories, fulfilling the bittersweet intent.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 4 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

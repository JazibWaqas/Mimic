⚠️ No selection
  ⚙️ V14.0: No moment plans generated, using V13.2 fallback
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text 'if life doesnt kill me, nostalgia will' transforms joyful imagery into a bittersweet burden; it demands footage that feels like a precious, lost artifact rather than a simple celebration.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A frantic, heart-aching reclamation of childhood chaos that serves as both a sanctuary and a source of melancholic longing.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit must lean into the 'overwhelming' nature of the text by saturating the Peak with group movement, while forcing a sense of intimacy in the Intro and Outro by selecting clips where children are closest to the lens. The vintage texture is the glue; the human connection is the weight.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 4 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 3 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

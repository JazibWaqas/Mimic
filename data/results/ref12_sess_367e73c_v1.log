  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a juxtaposition between the vibrant, uninhibited joy of the past and the melancholic weight of its absence in the present; it requires moments of pure, visceral human connection.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A poignant exploration of how the sheer intensity of past childhood happiness creates a beautiful but painful emotional burden in the present.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will lean into the high-energy 'JOY' of the library to create a 'fever dream' of memories, using the vintage VHS aesthetic to distance these moments from the present. By prioritizing clips with physical touch and eye contact, the system will ensure the 'nostalgia' feels personal and heavy rather than just a generic home video.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 4 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 3 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

================================================================================
💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundance of high-energy JOY clips perfectly suited for the narrative peak.
      - Strong presence of People-Group and Activity-Leisure subjects.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - High-energy clips must be re-contextualized as 'PEACE' or 'Nostalgia' through color grading and pacing due to lack of native low-energy footage.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Severe scarcity of true 'Low' energy clips for the reflective outro.
      - Lack of 'Medium' energy establishing shots.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will lean into the high-energy 'JOY' of the library to create a 'fever dream' of memories, using the vintage VHS aesthetic to distance these moments from the present. By prioritizing clips with physical touch and eye contact, the system will ensure the 'nostalgia' feels personal and heavy rather than just a generic home video.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate slow-motion 'liminal' shots of empty childhood spaces (empty swings, sun-drenched hallways) to provide the necessary 'PEACE' beats that the current high-energy library lacks.

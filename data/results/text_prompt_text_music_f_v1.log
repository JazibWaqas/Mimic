[OK] Using Gemini 3 model: gemini-3-flash-preview
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: A bittersweet yearning for the unburdened vitality and pure presence of childhood, demanding moments of unfiltered, kinetic joy that feel like a lost dream.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: This video is a visceral time capsule of childhood's chaotic beauty, framed through the lens of adult nostalgia and the realization of time's velocity.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: I am prioritizing the 'kinetic' interpretation of the text overlay. Since the library is biased toward high-intensity home videos, the edit will lean into the 'wildness' of being young, using the peak to create a dizzying sense of life before dropping into a quiet, intimate outro to land the emotional 'Oh' of the text.
  ✅ Advisor enabled: Strategic guidance active

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 1 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - The library is exceptionally rich in high-energy 'Peak' material that captures authentic childhood joy.
      - Human presence is dominant in every clip, satisfying the narrative anchor requirements.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The library lacks true 'Low' energy, quiet observational shots. I am forced to use the beginning of more active clips (like the birthday or the hug) to simulate the 'Breath' required for the Intro and Outro.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Missing sun-drenched, static close-ups of objects (toys, candles) to provide the 'Detail' function in the Outro.
      - Lack of slow-motion footage to emphasize the 'lingering' feel of the nostalgic narrative.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   I am prioritizing the 'kinetic' interpretation of the text overlay. Since the library is biased toward high-intensity home videos, the edit will lean into the 'wildness' of being young, using the peak to create a dizzying sense of life before dropping into a quiet, intimate outro to land the emotional 'Oh' of the text.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true 'Director's Cut,' capture 3-4 low-intensity, observational shots of childhood artifacts (a discarded toy, a sunlit window) and 1-2 slow-motion close-ups of a child's face. This will provide the necessary 'silence' to balance the current library's high-volume energy.

  ✅ V14.0: 1 segment(s) with contextual moment plans
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The location is merely a backdrop; the soul of the memory is found exclusively in the uninhibited collective energy and shared laughter of the group.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A high-octane celebration of brotherhood and shared adventure where the collective energy of the group transforms every setting into a meaningful memory.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will prioritize the 'People' by using vehicle-based singing and shouting as the rhythmic engine of the build-up. By clustering the most physical celebrations (carrying people, dancing) at the peak, we transform a simple trip into a manifesto on friendship.

       Advisor reasoning: Selected the Medium energy moment from clip103 because it perfectly aligns with the 'Camaraderie' vibe and 'Medium' energy requirement of the intro. As a 'Long' expected hold, this moment's stability is prioritized to establish the scene effectively, and the duration was slightly extended from the candidate's 3.0s to 3.72s to maintain a single, continuous shot as per the Restraint Rule.

================================================================================
💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundance of high-energy group celebration footage perfectly matches the 'People' focus.
      - Strong variety of vehicle-based 'transit' shots supports the travel narrative.
      - High-quality candid laughter moments are available for the outro.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The lack of 'Nature' and 'Snow' clips means the 'Place' will feel more urban and interior-heavy than the reference.
      - Scarcity of true 'Medium' energy clips requires using lower-intensity 'High' clips for the intro and outro.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - The 'Nostalgic' tone of the reference is harder to achieve with the predominantly high-intensity, modern-feeling library clips.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize the 'People' by using vehicle-based singing and shouting as the rhythmic engine of the build-up. By clustering the most physical celebrations (carrying people, dancing) at the peak, we transform a simple trip into a manifesto on friendship.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To reach a Director's Cut, I would integrate slow-motion close-ups of individual expressions to add a layer of 'Nostalgia' and include wide-angle scenic 'Place' shots to provide a stronger visual contrast for the 'People' message.

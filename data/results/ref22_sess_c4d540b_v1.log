  🧠 Calling Gemini for strategic guidance...
[OK] Using Gemini 3 model: gemini-3-flash-preview
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The 'TOP GUN MAVERICK' branding demands a cinematic language of elite heroism, where the machine is an extension of the pilot's will and the legacy of naval aviation is treated as sacred.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A visceral exploration of the symbiotic relationship between a legendary pilot and the high-performance machinery that defines his existence.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit must prioritize the 'Pilot-Machine' bond. Every high-energy jet maneuver should be preceded or followed by a shot of the pilot's intense focus or a mechanical trigger (throttle/visor). We will lean into the 'Teal-Orange' color grade to unify the disparate desert and sea locations, ensuring the 'Top Gun' text feels like a natural title card for a high-stakes cinematic event.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy aviation footage perfectly matching the 'Top Gun' aesthetic.
      - Strong selection of 'Hero' pilot shots in cockpits.
      - Excellent golden-hour lighting across multiple key clips.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The scarcity of 'Medium' energy clips requires using 'High' energy clips with speed ramps to simulate a build-up.
      - Limited 'People-Group' footage means the 'camaraderie' aspect of the narrative will be secondary to the 'Solo Hero' arc.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of indoor briefing room or locker room footage to ground the military realism.
      - Minimal 'Low' energy transition material for a more nuanced emotional release in the outro.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit must prioritize the 'Pilot-Machine' bond. Every high-energy jet maneuver should be preceded or followed by a shot of the pilot's intense focus or a mechanical trigger (throttle/visor). We will lean into the 'Teal-Orange' color grade to unify the disparate desert and sea locations, ensuring the 'Top Gun' text feels like a natural title card for a high-stakes cinematic event.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate more 'Low' energy dialogue-free moments of pilots interacting on the flight deck to humanize the hardware. Additionally, more 'Place-Indoor' shots of flight simulators or hangars would enhance the 'Build-up' phase's sense of preparation.

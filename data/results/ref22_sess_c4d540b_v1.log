   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 1 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage that matches the 'adrenaline' requirement.
      - Strong technical/mechanical clips (wind tunnel, start lights) to build narrative depth.
      - High-quality 5/5 clips provide the necessary 'filmic' polish.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - F1 racing must serve as a thematic proxy for naval aviation; the 'Maverick' persona is projected onto the driver.
      - Training/boxing footage is used to simulate the physical rigors of flight training.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of actual aircraft necessitates a heavy reliance on 'Object-Vehicle' speed to maintain the Top Gun energy.
      - Scarcity of 'Low' energy clips makes the 'Solemn' requirement for the outro difficult to sustain without careful selection.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will pivot the 'Top Gun' aviation theme into a high-stakes Formula 1 narrative. By treating the race car as a fighter jet and the driver as a 'Maverick' figure, we maintain the emotional core of elite heroism. The pacing will be syncopated, using technical preparation to justify the explosive, high-energy peak.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, integrate 21:9 anamorphic plates of desert landscapes to mimic the 'Mojave' look. Add extreme macro close-ups of eyes and sweat to heighten the human stakes against the cold machinery.

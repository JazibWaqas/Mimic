💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 3 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

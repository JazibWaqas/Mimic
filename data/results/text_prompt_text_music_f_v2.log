  💡 Text Overlay Intent: A yearning for the uninhibited joy and physical freedom of childhood, demanding moments of pure, unfiltered human connection and play.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: Childhood is a collection of high-energy, tactile memories that feel like a blur of motion and laughter when viewed through the lens of nostalgia.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: I am prioritizing emotional proximity over technical energy labels. Because the library is 'High Energy' dominant, I will use the most intimate, camera-facing moments to bookend the piece, creating a 'pseudo-slow' start and finish through subject matter rather than clip velocity.
  ✅ Advisor enabled: Strategic guidance active

   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 4 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

================================================================================
💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Exceptional abundance of authentic, high-energy joyful interactions.
      - Strong 'People-Group' presence that perfectly matches the 'we/us' nostalgia of the text.
      - Multiple clips with direct camera engagement (participatory).

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The library lacks true 'Low' energy clips; the Intro and Outro must rely on the emotional weight of 'hugs' or 'swings' to substitute for technical stillness.
      - The 'Nature' requirement is under-represented, forcing a heavier reliance on indoor family settings.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Missing slow-motion footage which would better serve the 'Nostalgic' and 'Peaceful' stages.
      - Lack of wide-angle outdoor 'Place-Nature' shots to provide scale to the childhood journey.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   I am prioritizing emotional proximity over technical energy labels. Because the library is 'High Energy' dominant, I will use the most intimate, camera-facing moments to bookend the piece, creating a 'pseudo-slow' start and finish through subject matter rather than clip velocity.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To reach Director's Cut quality, capture 3-4 low-energy, wide-angle shots of children in nature (e.g., running through a field at sunset). This will provide the necessary 'Breath' and 'Peace' that the current indoor-heavy, high-intensity library struggles to sustain.

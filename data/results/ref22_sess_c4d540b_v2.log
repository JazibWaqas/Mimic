   → Add 3 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 1 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 1 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundance of high-quality, high-energy vehicle footage that matches the 'Maverick' intensity.
      - Strong selection of night-time and high-contrast lighting (fireworks, stadium lights) to mimic the 'Golden Hour' cinematic feel.
      - Excellent technical/industrial shots (wind tunnel, cockpit) for narrative build-up.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - F1 racing must serve as a proxy for naval aviation; the 'cockpit' feel is the primary bridge.
      - The lack of natural 'vistas' means urban tracks and stadium lights must provide the 'sweeping' scale usually reserved for landscapes.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Very scarce low-energy/reflective material makes the 'Solemn moments' difficult to sustain without repeating clips.
      - Lack of 'Golden Hour' nature shots requires a heavier reliance on sunset-colored urban/track footage.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will pivot from the aviation-specific reference to a 'Land-Based Maverick' narrative, using Formula 1 as the vehicle for elite competition. We will prioritize shots that emphasize the 'cockpit' experience and the sheer physical toll of speed to maintain the 'Top Gun' intensity.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, we would need to integrate 35mm-style grain overlays and more 'Golden Hour' coastal vistas to break the urban monotony. Adding more intimate, non-racing character beats (e.g., a pilot/driver in a locker room) would deepen the 'Legacy' aspect of the narrative.

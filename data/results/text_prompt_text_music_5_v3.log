  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a contrast between the slow, atmospheric passage of time ('long days') and the enduring, high-impact emotional weight of family bonds ('forever love').
  📖 Dominant Narrative: Childhood is a fleeting collection of high-energy joy anchored by the enduring safety of family love.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will lean into the 'Nostalgic Verité' style by using the most candid, unpolished moments of play to build a sense of authentic memory. We will prioritize the emotional resonance of group laughter over the technical quality of the shots, ensuring the 'forever love' message is anchored by the hug in clip 95.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 2 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 5 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy 'JOY' content that captures raw, unpolished childhood moments.
      - Strong selection of group interactions which supports the 'People-centric' requirement.
      - Clip 95 provides the mandatory 'physical affection' beat for the ending.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The library is heavily skewed toward high energy; the 'PEACE' required for the Intro and Outro must be extracted from the quieter tails or heads of more active clips.
      - Verité style must be enforced through grading and effects rather than relying on naturally 'vintage' source footage.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of true 'Low' energy atmospheric B-roll (e.g., empty rooms, sunbeams) to establish the 'long days' metaphor.
      - Limited 'soft focus' or 'natural light' specific shots; the system must prioritize clips with the warmest indoor lighting.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will lean into the 'Nostalgic Verité' style by using the most candid, unpolished moments of play to build a sense of authentic memory. We will prioritize the emotional resonance of group laughter over the technical quality of the shots, ensuring the 'forever love' message is anchored by the hug in clip 95.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate macro-photography of childhood artifacts (toys, old photos) and slow-motion close-ups of hands to better bridge the gap between the high-energy play and the reflective narrative intent.

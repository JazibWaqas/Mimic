  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The phrase 'The magic of being small' establishes a perspective of wonder and fleeting innocence, demanding shots that emphasize the scale of the world relative to a child and the uninhibited expression of discovery.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: Childhood is a high-velocity blur of discovery and kinetic energy that finds its ultimate meaning and safety in the warmth of human connection.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will lean heavily into the 'JOY' vibe to represent the 'magic' of childhood, using the abundance of high-energy clips to create a breathless build-up. To achieve the 'PEACE' intent despite library scarcity, the edit must prioritize clips with physical contact (hugs, lying on the floor) for the resolution, using the emotional weight of connection to substitute for visual stillness.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 2 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 1 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy 'Peak' material featuring genuine laughter and kinetic movement.
      - Strong representation of 'People-Group' and 'JOY' canonical vibes.
      - Multiple clips featuring the 'Must-Have' close-up smiles and fast movement.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Due to the scarcity of 'Low' energy clips, the 'Outro' must rely on high-energy clips that contain moments of physical intimacy (hugs) to provide the narrative 'rest'.
      - The 'Intro' will use school or birthday settings to 'Establish' the narrative despite their higher energy levels.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of true 'Low' energy, quiet, or 'Place-Nature' shots for a traditional 'Peaceful' exhale.
      - Absence of specific 'sun flare' or 'tactile detail' (grass/hands) shots, requiring a focus on facial expressions to carry the nostalgia.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will lean heavily into the 'JOY' vibe to represent the 'magic' of childhood, using the abundance of high-energy clips to create a breathless build-up. To achieve the 'PEACE' intent despite library scarcity, the edit must prioritize clips with physical contact (hugs, lying on the floor) for the resolution, using the emotional weight of connection to substitute for visual stillness.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To reach a Director's Cut, I would integrate slow-motion B-roll of tactile details—hands brushing through grass or dust motes in sunbeams—and wide, static 'Place-Nature' shots at golden hour to provide the necessary visual 'exhale' and reinforce the vintage film aesthetic.

  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text functions as a digital signature and aggressive call-to-action, demanding a visual style that mirrors the 'edit culture' of social media—where the editor's presence is as loud and high-status as the luxury brands listed.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A relentless pursuit of speed and prestige, where the mechanical violence of racing meets the polished glamour of the Formula 1 lifestyle.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: Maintain a 'relentless' rhythmic structure by prioritizing clips with internal camera motion and high-contrast lighting. Use the 'technical' clips to create a sense of mounting pressure before releasing into the 'peak' racing sequences.
  ✅ Advisor enabled: Strategic guidance active

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage
      - Strong night-time and firework visuals matching the reference aesthetic
      - High-quality technical and training shots to support the build-up

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Using fictional racing footage (Brad Pitt/APXGP) to supplement real-world F1 intensity
      - Relying on training montages to maintain energy when racing clips are exhausted

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Limited 'lifestyle/wealth' symbols (money) as requested, requiring urban Las Vegas shots to act as proxies for glamour

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   Maintain a 'relentless' rhythmic structure by prioritizing clips with internal camera motion and high-contrast lighting. Use the 'technical' clips to create a sense of mounting pressure before releasing into the 'peak' racing sequences.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To elevate this to a Director's Cut, integrate more macro-photography of engine components and high-fidelity sound design of downshifts to ground the visual speed in auditory weight.

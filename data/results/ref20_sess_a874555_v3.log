  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a high-prestige cinematic blockbuster atmosphere that prioritizes professional dominance, technical mastery, and the 'Hero' archetype found in elite-tier sports and military operations.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The symbiotic relationship between an elite operator and their high-performance machine, where technical precision meets raw, visceral speed.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will treat the fighter jets as the spiritual equivalent of F1 cars, focusing on the 'Operator vs. Machine' narrative. By anchoring the high-speed action with intense human close-ups, the system will replicate the 'F1 The Movie' trailer's emotional arc—moving from the quiet focus of the garage (hangar) to the violent speed of the track (sky).

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 15 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 1 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 2 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy aviation footage that mirrors the 'F1' speed requirement.
      - Strong 'Hero' imagery of pilots that aligns with the driver-focused intent.
      - High-quality cinematic textures (grain, lens flares, golden hour) matching the reference style.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Aviation assets must serve as a narrative proxy for automotive racing to maintain the 'F1' text intent.
      - Limited 'Medium' energy clips require careful pacing in the build-up to avoid a premature jump to peak energy.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of actual Formula 1 vehicles; the edit must rely on the 'feeling' of speed and technical precision rather than literal subject matter.
      - Scarce indoor/technical display shots may limit the 'technical precision' aspect of the reference.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will treat the fighter jets as the spiritual equivalent of F1 cars, focusing on the 'Operator vs. Machine' narrative. By anchoring the high-speed action with intense human close-ups, the system will replicate the 'F1 The Movie' trailer's emotional arc—moving from the quiet focus of the garage (hangar) to the violent speed of the track (sky).

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, integrate macro-photography of mechanical components (pistons, telemetry screens) and high-frame-rate shots of driver/pilot perspiration to heighten the physical toll of the speed.

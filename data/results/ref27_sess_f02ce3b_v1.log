      - Strong selection of 'People-Solo' training and focus clips (Brad Pitt, training mask).
      - High-quality crash and high-stakes action sequences.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarcity of 'Medium' energy clips requires using high-energy clips with 'Establishing' utility for the intro.
      - The 'Relentless' pacing must be manufactured through tight cutting of high-energy clips rather than relying on varied energy levels.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of specific sponsor-branded close-ups (Shark Ninja, Expensify) mentioned in the text overlay.
      - Limited 'Place-Nature' clips to fulfill the 'drifting' and 'smoke' requirements in a non-urban setting.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize the 'Man vs. Machine' narrative by intercutting technical car preparation with intense human focus. We will maintain a 'Relentless' pace by favoring clips with high internal motion and using the driver's training/focus as the narrative anchor that justifies the high-speed racing action.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To elevate this to a Director's Cut, I would integrate macro-photography of the driver's eyes and specific sponsor-branded gear to more literally fulfill the 'Text Overlay' requirements and deepen the 'Strategy' theme.

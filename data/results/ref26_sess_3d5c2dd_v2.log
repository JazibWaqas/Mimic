  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The presence of elite global brands demands a visual language of professional dominance, high-tier engineering, and the absolute pinnacle of human-machine synergy.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A cinematic exploration of the high-stakes, high-velocity life of an elite pilot, balancing the raw power of machinery with the heavy weight of personal legacy.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will pivot from the F1 racing context to a 'Top Gun' style narrative, using the high-energy jet maneuvers to satisfy the 'Relentless' pacing while utilizing the funeral and nostalgic photo clips to ground the 'Personal Stakes' mentioned in the reference intent.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 2 more HIGH-ENERGY clips (dancing, sports, action, fast movement)
   → Add 17 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 1 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 4 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 3 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy, high-quality (5/5) action footage that matches the 'Relentless' pacing.
      - Strong thematic overlap between F1 racing and elite fighter pilot culture.
      - Excellent 'Mechanical details' and 'Driver intimacy' equivalents in the cockpit shots.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The 'Crashes/High stakes' requirement is met by dogfights and explosions rather than racing accidents.
      - The 'Branding/Sponsorship' intent is carried by the elite nature of the military hardware rather than explicit logos.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of 'Crowd/Atmosphere' shots; the library is more solitary than the F1 reference.
      - No 'Night racing' equivalent, though dusk/golden hour shots provide a similar high-contrast aesthetic.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will pivot from the F1 racing context to a 'Top Gun' style narrative, using the high-energy jet maneuvers to satisfy the 'Relentless' pacing while utilizing the funeral and nostalgic photo clips to ground the 'Personal Stakes' mentioned in the reference intent.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate more 'Ground Crew' footage to simulate the F1 pit-stop energy and seek out night-flight footage with heavy lens flares to match the 'Night racing' and 'Teal-Orange' filmic look of the reference.

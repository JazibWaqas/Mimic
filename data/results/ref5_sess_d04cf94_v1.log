  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text 'For the stories we'll tell later' establishes a retrospective, legacy-building intent. It demands footage that feels like a 'core memory'—moments of high emotional resonance and shared experience that justify being recounted in the future.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A high-energy retrospective of a brotherhood's journey, blending the awe of the landscape with the chaotic joy of shared experience.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will prioritize the contrast between the 'Vastness' of the Pakistani landscape and the 'Intimacy' of the group's laughter. By bookending the chaotic, high-energy JOY of the peak with the ADVENTURE and PEACE of the natural world, we transform a simple trip montage into a nostalgic memory reel.

      - Multiple clips of genuine, high-intensity laughter which directly fulfill the 'stories we'll tell' intent.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The scarcity of Low-energy footage means the PEACE-driven intro and outro must rely on shorter durations of Medium-energy nature clips.
      - Many high-energy clips are indoor/night-based, requiring careful balancing against the 'Golden Hour' reference requirement.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Limited 'Bus/Transportation' shots beyond the van and plane; the edit will have to lean heavily on the van footage (clip_121) to satisfy this 'Should-Have' content.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize the contrast between the 'Vastness' of the Pakistani landscape and the 'Intimacy' of the group's laughter. By bookending the chaotic, high-energy JOY of the peak with the ADVENTURE and PEACE of the natural world, we transform a simple trip montage into a nostalgic memory reel.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate more slow-motion close-ups of individual friends during golden hour to heighten the 'Nostalgic' tone. Additionally, capturing more rhythmic, percussive sounds from the travel itself (wheels on road, plane engines) would better support the syncopated pacing.

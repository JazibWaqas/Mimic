  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The phrase 'Oh, to be this young again' functions as a retrospective sigh, framing the footage as a precious, unreachable memory that demands scenes of total unselfconscious immersion in play.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A visceral, sun-drenched recollection of the unscripted joy and physical freedom found in childhood, framed through a lens of nostalgic longing.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The strategy is to re-contextualize high-energy home videos as a dreamlike memory. We will use the 'Reflection' utility clips to anchor the PEACE vibe at the start and end, while allowing the JOY-heavy clips to dominate the center, ensuring the 'bittersweet' intent is felt through the contrast of energy.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 1 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 5 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy JOY content that perfectly matches the 'pure joy' requirement.
      - Strong selection of candid, unposed moments that avoid the 'staged' look.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Due to the scarcity of Low/Medium energy clips, the system must use 'High' energy clips with 'Reflection' utility for the Intro and Outro, focusing on the tail ends of shots where movement settles.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of true 'Low' energy, quiet, or static observational shots to provide the 'breathable' pacing requested in the reference.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The strategy is to re-contextualize high-energy home videos as a dreamlike memory. We will use the 'Reflection' utility clips to anchor the PEACE vibe at the start and end, while allowing the JOY-heavy clips to dominate the center, ensuring the 'bittersweet' intent is felt through the contrast of energy.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To elevate this to a Director's Cut, I would add slow-motion 'Place-Nature' shots during golden hour and extreme close-ups of tactile details (hands in dirt, feet on grass) to heighten the sensory nostalgia.

   → 6 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 12 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Excellent variety of high-energy group interactions (laughter, van dancing, running).
      - Strong 'North' context with snowy paths and mountain landscapes.
      - Good availability of 'Hero' shots (clip8) to anchor the realization.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Using urban/indoor laughter (clip82, clip90) to supplement group energy where outdoor group footage is less 'chaotic'.
      - Relying on sunny nature shots (clip45) despite the 'moody/foggy' intent due to a lack of desaturated mountain clips.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Missing 'campfire' or 'warm contrast' shots mentioned in the reference to balance the cool tones.
      - Lack of 'foggy/moody' specific group shots; most group shots are in clear or night lighting.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   Prioritize the 'People-Group' anchor above all else. If a clip doesn't feature the friends, it must serve as a direct atmospheric bridge to the next group moment. The 'North' is the setting, but the 'Friends' are the story. We will lean into the desaturated, cool-toned clips to maintain the nostalgic, soul-cleansing aesthetic requested.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To reach Director's Cut quality, replace the high-saturation 'sunny' nature clips with more foggy, overcast mountain footage. Additionally, capture or insert 2-3 shots of the group around a warm light source (fire/lantern) to provide the 'Should-Have' contrast against the cool mountain fog.

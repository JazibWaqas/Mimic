      High→Medium: 2 times
      Low→Medium: 1 times

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 14 more HIGH-ENERGY clips (dancing, sports, action, fast movement)
   → Add 20 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 4 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 3 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage (ACTION)
      - Strong night-racing and firework visuals for the Peak
      - Excellent crash and reaction footage (clip71, clip72) for high-stakes narrative

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarce 'Low' energy footage means the Outro must rely heavily on the few reflective moments available (clip50, clip77)
      - Medium energy 'Build-up' material is limited, requiring high-energy training clips to be paced as tension-builders

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of extreme close-up mechanical details (pedals, steering wheel) as requested in 'Must-Have' content
      - Limited 'Static' branding shots, requiring the use of press-event backdrops (clip73) to satisfy sponsorship intent

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize 'Relentless' pacing by favoring clips with internal forward motion that carries across cuts. We will anchor the mechanical speed with human grit—using the training and reaction clips as the 'soul' of the machine. The transition from the technical build-up to the chaotic peak will be triggered by the race-start lights (clip74).

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, additional macro-photography of glowing brake discs and extreme close-ups of a driver's eyes behind a visor are needed to heighten the 'intimacy' and 'mechanical detail' requirements.

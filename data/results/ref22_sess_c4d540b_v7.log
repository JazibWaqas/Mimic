  🧠 Calling Gemini for strategic guidance...
[OK] Using Gemini 3 model: gemini-3-flash-preview
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The 'TOP GUN MAVERICK' stencil demands an aesthetic of professional dominance and the heavy weight of legacy; it requires shots that frame the protagonist not just as a participant, but as a master of a high-stakes, high-velocity craft.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A visceral exploration of the intersection between human focus and mechanical violence, where the pursuit of speed is balanced by the solemnity of professional duty.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will treat the racetrack as a battlefield. By anchoring the narrative on the 'Driver' as a 'Pilot' figure, we use the high-speed F1 footage to replicate the G-force intensity of flight. The sequence must prioritize the 'Man-Machine' interface, moving from the cold precision of the garage to the violent heat of the track, finally resolving in the quiet dignity of the winner's circle.
  ✅ Advisor enabled: Strategic guidance active

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-intensity racing footage that serves as a perfect surrogate for aerial combat.
      - Strong 'Hero' imagery with Brad Pitt and professional drivers providing the necessary 'Maverick' archetype.
      - Excellent technical b-roll (wind tunnels, start lights) to build cinematic tension.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Using Formula 1 as a proxy for Naval Aviation; the edit must rely on speed and 'cockpit' intimacy to bridge the thematic gap.
      - Limited 'Nature' shots means the 'vast landscape' requirement must be fulfilled by wide track shots or desert urban settings.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Scarcity of 'Low' energy reflective moments requires stretching clip50 and clip77 to carry the entire emotional weight of the outro.
      - Lack of actual aircraft requires the 'Object-Vehicle' shots to be edited with extreme kinetic bias to maintain the Top Gun feel.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will treat the racetrack as a battlefield. By anchoring the narrative on the 'Driver' as a 'Pilot' figure, we use the high-speed F1 footage to replicate the G-force intensity of flight. The sequence must prioritize the 'Man-Machine' interface, moving from the cold precision of the garage to the violent heat of the track, finally resolving in the quiet dignity of the winner's circle.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, integrate 35mm grain overlays and authentic cockpit radio chatter. Adding shots of vast desert horizons or actual jet flyovers would solidify the 'Top Gun' legacy beyond the racing surrogate.

  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The phrase 'Oh, to be this young again' establishes a perspective of adult retrospection, demanding imagery that feels like a visceral memory of uninhibited freedom and lost innocence.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: Childhood is a fleeting, high-energy symphony of play and connection that leaves a lingering warmth of nostalgia.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will leverage the abundance of high-energy group play to create a dense, rhythmic 'Peak' of childhood joy, while bookending the narrative with the few available intimate, slower-paced moments to satisfy the 'Bittersweet Longing' established by the text overlay.

   → Add 1 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 4 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

================================================================================
💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy 'Joy' content that perfectly matches the 'Peak' requirements.
      - Strong 'People-Group' presence for authentic family-centric storytelling.
      - Multiple clips featuring 'Active Movement' and 'Laughter'.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Due to the scarcity of 'Low' energy clips, the 'Intro' and 'Outro' must be manufactured by selecting the most intimate moments from 'High' energy clips or using slower-paced segments of longer files.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - The library lacks 'Sun-drenched' or 'Vintage' aesthetic clips, requiring heavy reliance on downstream color grading to achieve the 'Nostalgic' intent.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will leverage the abundance of high-energy group play to create a dense, rhythmic 'Peak' of childhood joy, while bookending the narrative with the few available intimate, slower-paced moments to satisfy the 'Bittersweet Longing' established by the text overlay.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate true slow-motion B-roll of sun-flared environments and quiet, static shots of childhood objects (toys, empty swings) to deepen the 'PEACE' and 'Nostalgia' vibes.

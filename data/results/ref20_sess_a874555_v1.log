  ⚙️ V14.0: No segments matched criteria
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a high-prestige, blockbuster cinematic event that prioritizes star power and directorial pedigree over raw documentary footage. It implies a narrative of professional dominance and the 'mythology' of the elite athlete.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The relentless pursuit of speed and prestige where human focus meets mechanical perfection.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will prioritize the 'Star' (People-Solo) in the intro and build-up to establish narrative stakes, then transition into a relentless ACTION-focused peak using high-motion vehicle shots. The final sequence will leverage the abundance of victory footage to create a high-energy, rhythmic conclusion that aligns with the '2025' release date reveal.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 17 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 4 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 1 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 6 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage (ACTION) and specific F1-related technical scenes (wind tunnel, track walk).
      - Strong presence of 'Star Power' cues through Brad Pitt and training montages.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The scarcity of 'Medium' and 'Low' energy clips means the 'Intro' will likely be more intense than the reference, requiring careful selection of technical details to ground the edit.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of intimate, non-racing close-ups of the secondary lead (Damson Idris) forces a heavier reliance on generic racing action to sustain the narrative.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize the 'Star' (People-Solo) in the intro and build-up to establish narrative stakes, then transition into a relentless ACTION-focused peak using high-motion vehicle shots. The final sequence will leverage the abundance of victory footage to create a high-energy, rhythmic conclusion that aligns with the '2025' release date reveal.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, additional 'Quiet Intensity' footage—such as extreme close-ups of eyes behind visors or hands trembling on a wheel—should be added to the Intro to contrast the explosive Peak. More 'Place-Indoor' garage tension would further elevate the 'Bruckheimer' cinematic style.

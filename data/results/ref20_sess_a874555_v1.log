     Whitelist: [1, 7]
  ⚙️ V14.0: No segments matched criteria
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a high-stakes blockbuster prestige aesthetic, framing the footage not as a highlight reel but as a narrative cinematic event centered on star power and professional legacy.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The relentless pursuit of speed and the psychological weight of professional dominance within the high-pressure world of Formula 1 racing.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will leverage the 'Starring' text by anchoring the high-octane action to the solo driver's perspective. We will use a 'pressure-cooker' structure: starting with the heavy, quiet atmosphere of the track, building through technical preparation, and detonating into a high-frequency montage of night racing and crashes, finally resolving on the human element of victory.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 18 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 3 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage (ACTION) perfectly matches the peak requirements.
      - Strong presence of 'Star' talent (Brad Pitt/Damson Idris) to anchor the narrative.
      - Excellent night-time and firework footage for cinematic flair.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarcity of Low/Medium energy clips requires stretching the 'Intro' and 'Outro' using reflective training or urban establishing shots.
      - The 'technical detail' requirement from the reference must be fulfilled by wind tunnel and cockpit shots due to lack of macro mechanical clips.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of extreme close-ups of eyes/helmets as requested in the 'Must-Have' list; will substitute with driver reaction shots and cockpit POVs.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will leverage the 'Starring' text by anchoring the high-octane action to the solo driver's perspective. We will use a 'pressure-cooker' structure: starting with the heavy, quiet atmosphere of the track, building through technical preparation, and detonating into a high-frequency montage of night racing and crashes, finally resolving on the human element of victory.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate macro-photography of driver pupils dilating and extreme close-ups of gear shifts. Adding more 'behind-the-scenes' grit—sweat, grease, and focused stares—would further elevate the human drama against the mechanical speed.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 17 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 4 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 5 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-quality, high-energy racing footage.
      - Strong presence of the primary subject (Brad Pitt/Drivers).
      - Excellent variety of night-time racing with high-contrast lighting.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - The scarcity of 'Low' energy clips forces a consistently aggressive pace, sacrificing quiet character moments for constant momentum.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Limited 'Medium' energy establishing shots makes the transition from Intro to Build-up very abrupt.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize a 'Relentless' pace, using the star power of the lead actors to anchor the high-octane racing action. We will lean into the Teal-Orange filmic grade by favoring night-time racing and high-contrast garage scenes to maintain a premium, cinematic aesthetic.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate more intimate, low-energy dialogue scenes to ground the spectacle. Adding more 'Place-Nature' or 'Place-Indoor' shots would provide the necessary breathing room to make the 'Peak' action feel even more explosive.

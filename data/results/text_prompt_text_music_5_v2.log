  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a juxtaposition of raw, unpolished play with a sophisticated, retrospective lens; it requires moments where the subjects are unaware of the camera, emphasizing 'fun' over 'performance' to validate the 'making memories' sentiment.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The chaotic, unscripted joy of childhood is the raw material of a lifelong family legacy.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: Prioritize the 'found footage' feel by selecting clips with the most natural, unposed interactions. Use the abundance of high-energy clips to create a dense, rhythmic 'Peak' that justifies the 'having fun' text, then force a hard deceleration into the 'Outro' using the most intimate, close-proximity clips available to anchor the emotional resolution.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 1 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 5 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy 'Peak' material that perfectly captures the 'having fun' aspect of the text.
      - Strong 'People-Group' presence which aligns with the family legacy intent.
      - Authentic, candid quality across most clips (3/5 quality) fits the 'found footage' aesthetic.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Due to the scarcity of Low/Medium energy clips, high-energy clips with 'Reflection' utility must be used for the Intro and Outro by selecting their calmest sub-segments.
      - The 'Establishing' function will rely on group-centric clips rather than traditional wide-angle scenics.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of true wide-angle establishing shots without people.
      - Scarcity of 'Low' energy content makes the 'Breathable and Reflective' pacing difficult to maintain without aggressive sub-clipping.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   Prioritize the 'found footage' feel by selecting clips with the most natural, unposed interactions. Use the abundance of high-energy clips to create a dense, rhythmic 'Peak' that justifies the 'having fun' text, then force a hard deceleration into the 'Outro' using the most intimate, close-proximity clips available to anchor the emotional resolution.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   Incorporate slow-motion macro shots of childhood artifacts (toys, worn shoes) to enhance the 'Attic Discovery' theme. Add wide-angle, static shots of empty play spaces to provide a stronger 'PEACE' anchor for the Intro and Outro stages.

  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The text demands a high-prestige cinematic trailer aesthetic that elevates Formula 1 from a sport to a dramatic narrative event, requiring a balance between celebrity presence and technical mastery.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: The relentless pursuit of professional dominance where human grit meets high-velocity engineering.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will prioritize the 'Professional Dominance' narrative by framing the racing action as the result of intense human preparation. By anchoring the high-energy peaks with training and technical motifs, the system will avoid a generic highlight reel feel and instead achieve the 'Movie Trailer' intent.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 18 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 2 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

      - Excellent night-time racing visuals with high contrast

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarcity of Medium/Low energy clips requires using training sequences (clip62, clip65) to simulate the 'Build-up' phase rather than pure racing.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Limited close-up eye/helmet shots of the specific lead actors compared to the reference's requirements, necessitating a focus on the 'Driver' archetype.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize the 'Professional Dominance' narrative by framing the racing action as the result of intense human preparation. By anchoring the high-energy peaks with training and technical motifs, the system will avoid a generic highlight reel feel and instead achieve the 'Movie Trailer' intent.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To reach a Director's Cut level, additional macro-photography of driver eyes and vibrating cockpit components should be integrated to heighten the sensory connection between the human and the machine.

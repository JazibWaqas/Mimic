While the system executed the rhythmic acceleration well, the reliance on repetitive 'Action' and 'Reaction' shots suggests a library bottleneck where specific narrative beats were substituted with generic movement to maintain the beat. The result is a technically sound montage that captures the 'warm glow' of the brief, though the final high-energy demand in Segment 4 creates a slight thematic dissonance with the requested peaceful conclusion.",

  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The phrase 'The days that felt like forever' implies a suspension of time where the mundane becomes magical; it demands immersive, lingering moments of childhood presence rather than a rapid-fire montage.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: Childhood is a visceral journey from quiet observation to explosive physical joy, ultimately returning to the safety of human connection.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will lean heavily into the 'JOY' and 'ACTION' categories to fulfill the 'wild energy' requirement, using the abundance of high-intensity group play as the narrative engine. To respect the 'Nostalgic' and 'Peaceful' requirements of the reference, the system must prioritize clips with 'Intimate' and 'Reflection' tags for the bookends, even if their raw energy scores are high.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 2 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)
   → Add 2 more LOW-ENERGY clips (scenic, calm, establishing shots, landscapes)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 5 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy 'Joy' and 'Action' content for the narrative peak.
      - Strong 'People-Group' presence which aligns with the family-centric intent.
      - Consistent emotional tone across the library.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Due to the scarcity of 'Low' energy clips, the Intro and Outro must be carved out of 'Reflection' or 'Intimate' segments of higher-energy clips.
      - The 'Nostalgic' feel must be carried by color grading and effects rather than slow-motion or quiet cinematography.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of 'Golden Hour' or 'Nature' shots requires the narrative to rely entirely on indoor/rooftop human interaction.
      - Absence of true 'Low' energy establishing shots.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will lean heavily into the 'JOY' and 'ACTION' categories to fulfill the 'wild energy' requirement, using the abundance of high-intensity group play as the narrative engine. To respect the 'Nostalgic' and 'Peaceful' requirements of the reference, the system must prioritize clips with 'Intimate' and 'Reflection' tags for the bookends, even if their raw energy scores are high.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, incorporate slow-motion B-roll of tactile details (grass, sunlight through windows) and genuine low-energy observational footage of children at rest. This would provide the necessary 'breathable' contrast to the current high-energy library.

[OK] Using Gemini 3 model: gemini-3-flash-preview
  ✅ Advisor hints generated and cached
  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The 'TOP GUN MAVERICK' stencil demands an aesthetic of elite military professionalism and high-stakes legacy. It requires a visual language that balances the cold precision of advanced machinery with the warm, human sweat of the pilots who command them.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A visceral exploration of the cost and glory of elite aviation, where personal legacy meets the cutting edge of speed.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit will prioritize the 'Syncopated' pacing by alternating between the mechanical roar of the jets and the silent, heavy moments of character reflection. We will use the motorcycle and runway sequences as the connective tissue between the pilot's personal life and his professional duty, ensuring the 'Golden Hour' lighting acts as the visual glue for the entire narrative arc.

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THIS EDIT:
   [Inventory Gaps]
   → Add 2 more MEDIUM-ENERGY clips (walking, social, casual movement, city life)

   [Quality Improvements]
   → 1 segments wanted 'High' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add high-intensity clips with 'Urban' or 'Nightlife' vibes to fix this.
   → 2 segments wanted 'Low' energy but used 'Medium'.
     Add more 'Nature' or 'Calm' clips to reduce jitter here.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy aviation footage perfectly matching the 'Top Gun' aesthetic.
      - Strong 'Golden Hour' and 'Teal-Orange' color consistency across key clips.
      - Excellent variety of pilot-perspective and cockpit-intensity shots.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarcity of Medium-energy clips requires using high-energy clips with slower internal motion to simulate the build-up.
      - The 'solemn reflection' must be carried by static objects (photos, flags) due to a lack of quiet character dialogue.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Limited 'Activity-Celebration' footage makes the 'collective purpose' outro rely heavily on a few beach and bar-style clips.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will prioritize the 'Syncopated' pacing by alternating between the mechanical roar of the jets and the silent, heavy moments of character reflection. We will use the motorcycle and runway sequences as the connective tissue between the pilot's personal life and his professional duty, ensuring the 'Golden Hour' lighting acts as the visual glue for the entire narrative arc.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, additional footage of intimate, low-light dialogue between pilots would deepen the 'camaraderie' theme. More 'Medium' energy ground-crew footage would also help smooth the transition from the intro's facility reveal to the peak's aerial combat.

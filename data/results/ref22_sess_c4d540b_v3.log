  💡 Text Overlay Intent: The 'TOP GUN MAVERICK' branding demands a synthesis of legacy and lethality; it requires that every high-speed maneuver is anchored by the weight of history and the individual pilot's resolve.
  📖 Dominant Narrative: A visceral exploration of the symbiotic relationship between a legendary aviator and the cutting-edge machines that define his legacy.
  🎯 Editorial Strategy: The edit must prioritize the 'Man in the Machine' philosophy. We will use the abundant high-energy jet footage as the heartbeat, but the soul of the piece must be anchored in the scarce, intimate moments of reflection and preparation. By intercutting the intensity of the cockpit with the stillness of the pilot's personal history, we create a 'Triumphant' arc that feels earned rather than just loud.

💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-quality aerial action and cockpit footage.
      - Strong selection of 'Golden Hour' and 'Teal-Orange' graded material.
      - Excellent 'Hero' moments involving both the pilot and the aircraft.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - Scarcity of Medium-energy clips requires using High-energy clips with slower internal pacing to bridge the Build-up.
      - Limited indoor/facility variety means the 'Build-up' must lean heavily on nostalgic artifacts.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Lack of diverse ground-crew interaction to fully flesh out the 'Legacy' aspect of the carrier deck.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit must prioritize the 'Man in the Machine' philosophy. We will use the abundant high-energy jet footage as the heartbeat, but the soul of the piece must be anchored in the scarce, intimate moments of reflection and preparation. By intercutting the intensity of the cockpit with the stillness of the pilot's personal history, we create a 'Triumphant' arc that feels earned rather than just loud.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, I would integrate more 'Medium' energy ground-level operations to smooth the transition from reflection to flight. Additionally, adding specific foley-driven 'breathing' sequences over the cockpit close-ups would heighten the sensory immersion during the Peak.

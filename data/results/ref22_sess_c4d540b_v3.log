💡 POST-EDIT CREATIVE REVIEW (ADVISOR CRITIQUE)
================================================================================

🎨 THE EDITORIAL DEBRIEF:
   ✅ STRENGTHS:
      - Abundant high-energy racing footage perfectly mirrors the 'high-octane' requirement.
      - Strong 'Intensity' clips (training, wind tunnel) provide the necessary narrative weight.
      - Excellent 'Peak' material with crashes and night-racing fireworks.

   ⚠️ EDITORIAL TRADEOFFS:
      - F1 racing serves as a thematic proxy for Naval Aviation due to the lack of jet footage.
      - Urban night-scapes and track environments replace the 'vast landscapes' requested in the reference.

   🔍 CONSTRAINT GAPS:
      - Significant scarcity of 'Golden Hour' nature shots; the edit will rely on 'Teal-Orange' urban night lighting instead.
      - Limited 'Solemn Duty' moments; the narrative will lean more into 'Professional Intensity' to compensate.

🧠 EDITORIAL STRATEGY:
   The edit will pivot the 'Top Gun' military aesthetic into a high-performance racing narrative. By using the driver's physical and mental preparation as the emotional anchor, we transform mechanical speed into a story of human legacy and triumphant camaraderie.

🚀 REMAKE STRATEGY (HOW TO REACH DIRECTOR'S CUT):
   To achieve a true Director's Cut, integrate actual aerial cinematography and desert 'Golden Hour' wide shots. Increasing the frequency of extreme close-ups on the eyes would further heighten the 'Intensity' carrier to match the reference's character focus.

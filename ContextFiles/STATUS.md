## ✅ Completed Features

### The Collaborative Director Pipeline (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Stage 1-3: Adaptive Analysis** - Gemini analyzes Reference and Clips with Adaptive Rhythm awareness
- ✅ **Stage 4: Strategic Advisor** - Generates creative blueprint and assesses library readiness with narrative subject locking
- ✅ **Stage 5: Semantic Editor** - Narrative Budgeting (Emotional Capital) prevents clip fatigue and ensures character continuity
- ✅ **Stage 6: Aesthetic Stylist** - Hardened FFmpeg filters with automatic punctuation reconciliation for 100% demo stability
- ✅ **Stage 7: Post-Render Reflection** - AI critique with remake strategy and editorial debrief

### Performance & Quality Achievements
- ✅ **Perfect Diversity** - Local memory logic ensures 100% unique clip usage (0 reps) for demos
- ✅ **Narrative Budgeting** - Tracks "Hero" energy and "Filler" penalties to manage storytelling pace
- ✅ **Narrative Subject Locking** - Primary subject enforcement (e.g., "People-Group" for friend videos)
- ✅ **Cache Inheritance** - Reuses multimodal intelligence while allowing strategic shifts
- ✅ **API Key Rotation** - 28-key high-throughput rotation for seamless presentations
- ✅ **Production Hardening** - File validation, environment variables, API consistency

### Frontend Excellence
- ✅ **Vault Dashboard** - Clinical telemetry with editorial decisions, AI insights, and recommended actions
- ✅ **Search & Filter** - Real-time asset search across results, references, and clips
- ✅ **Thumbnail Generation** - Smart multi-point sampling to avoid black frames
- ✅ **Intelligence Reports** - Complete whitebox reasoning for every edit decision
- ✅ **Refinement Workflow** - One-click remake with advisor critique pinned

## 🎯 Recent Improvements (V11.0 - Feb 1, 2026)

### Production Hardening
- ✅ **File Extension Validation** - Rejects non-.mp4 uploads with clear error messages
- ✅ **API Response Consistency** - Unified `path` field across all asset types
- ✅ **Environment Variables** - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for deployment flexibility
- ✅ **Thumbnail Infrastructure** - Verified complete coverage for results, clips, references

### Architectural Fixes
- ✅ **Orchestrator AttributeError** - Fixed Pydantic model access in post-edit debrief
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Consistent TypeScript interfaces matching backend responses
- ✅ **URL Configuration** - No hardcoded localhost in production paths

### Documented Tradeoffs
- ✅ **Session State** - In-memory by design (single-user workflow, disk-based recovery)
- ✅ **No Locking** - UI prevention sufficient for demo context
- ✅ **Cache Strategy** - Infinite growth acceptable for demo, eviction deferred

## 🔍 Known Limitations (By Design)

### Explicitly Accepted Tradeoffs
1. **In-Memory Sessions** - Ephemeral by design, disk-based recovery via filesystem scan
2. **No WebSocket Reconnection** - Demo is synchronous, connection drops are edge cases
3. **Unbounded Cache** - Single-session context, eviction deferred to production phase
4. **Generic Error Messages** - Sufficient for demo, structured errors deferred

### Architectural Decisions
> "MIMIC prioritizes deterministic artifact reconstruction over live session durability. For a single-user creative workflow, explicit locking adds complexity without improving editorial correctness."

## 📝 Next Steps (Post-Demo)

### Production Hardening (Deferred)
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection logic
- [ ] Structured error types with status codes
- [ ] Cache eviction with LRU policy
- [ ] Request timeout configuration
- [ ] Session locking for multi-user scenarios

### Feature Enhancements (Future)
- [ ] Batch processing multiple references
- [ ] Custom vibe definitions
- [ ] Manual override controls
- [ ] Real-time collaborative editing

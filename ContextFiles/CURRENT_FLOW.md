# 🌊 MIMIC - Agentic Development Flow (V12.1)

This document details the exact sequence of logic implemented in the MIMIC pipeline as of **February 5, 2026**.

## 🚀 The Agentic Flow (Plan -> Execute -> Style)

### 1. Pre-Analysis (The Brain)
- **Visual Scene Grounding:** FFmpeg identifies physical cuts as **"Sacred Cuts"** to protect the reference's original soul.
- **Rhythmic Extraction:** Librosa extracts BPM/beat grid.
- **Pacing Authority (V12.1):** Inverts the authority. Narrative intent (Editor) now leads, and Beats follow as ornament.
- **Gemini Analysis:** Extracts the "Editorial DNA" (Energy, Motion, Vibes, Arc Stage, Typography, Tone). Requests contextual "Best Moments" (1.2s-6s).

### 2. Strategic Planning (The Advisor)
- **Library Audit:** The Advisor scans materials to identify coverage (e.g., "Need more Medium-energy clips").
- **Narrative Strategy:** Injects weights to ensure Intro/Build-up/Peak/Outro consistency.

### 3. Selective Assembly (The Editor)
- **Weighted-Greedy Search:** Scores clips based on Discovery Bonus (+40), Vibe Match (+15), and Arc Consistency (+10).
- **Director-Led Pacing:** Calculates narrative duration first (with jitter) before snapping to beats.
- **Beat-Snapping:** Snaps to beats ONLY if audio was detectable and correctly analyzed.
- **Micro-Moment Extraction:** High-precision FFmpeg surgical cuts.

### 4. Aesthetic Styling (The Stylist)
- **Type Spec Transfer:** Maps reference text to premium local fonts (Georgia, Serif).
- **Cinematic Grading:** Applies tone, contrast, and filmic look adjustments via FFmpeg filter chains.

### [UPCOMING] 5. AI Reflection (The Reflector)
- **Judicial Audit:** Gemini watches the final MP4 and scores the fidelity. [Planned for Post-Hackathon]

## 🏗️ Technical Integrity

- **Cache Inheritance:** Reuses expansive AI analysis across different rhythmic experiments for instant results.
- **Standardization Cache:** 100% persistent hash-based reuse.
- **Timeline Continuity:** Zero-gap enforcement via mathematical start/end snapping.

# 🌊 MIMIC - Agentic Development Flow (V9.0)

This document details the exact sequence of logic implemented in the MIMIC pipeline as of **January 31, 2026**.

## 🚀 The Agentic Flow (Plan -> Execute -> Style)

### 1. Pre-Analysis (The Brain)
- **Visual Scene Grounding:** FFmpeg identifies physical cuts to anchor the AI's temporal reasoning.
- **Rhythmic Extraction:** Librosa extracts the BPM and beat grid from the reference audio.
- **Adaptive Rhythm Calculation:** Determines the ideal shot density (e.g., Respecting Cinematic Holds vs. High-Energy Riffs).
- **Gemini Analysis:** mapping the "Aesthetic Blueprint" (Energy, Motion, Vibes, Arc Stage, Typography, Tone).

### 2. Strategic Planning (The Advisor)
- **Library Audit:** The Advisor scans materials to identify coverage (e.g., "Need more Medium-energy clips").
- **Narrative Strategy:** Injects weights to ensure Intro/Build-up/Peak/Outro consistency.

### 3. Selective Assembly (The Editor)
- **Weighted-Greedy Search:** Scores clips based on Discovery Bonus (+40), Vibe Match (+15), and Arc Consistency (+10).
- **Beat-Snapping:** Every decision is mathematically aligned to a musical anchor.
- **Micro-Moment Extraction:** High-precision FFmpeg surgical cuts.

### 4. Aesthetic Styling (The Stylist)
- **Type Spec Transfer:** Maps reference text to premium local fonts (Georgia, Serif).
- **Cinematic Grading:** Applies tone, contrast, and filmic look adjustments via FFmpeg filter chains.

### [UPCOMING] 5. AI Reflection (The Reflector)
- **Judicial Audit:** Gemini watches the final MP4 and scores the fidelity. [Planned for Post-Hackathon]

## 🏗️ Technical Integrity

- **Cache Inheritance:** Reuses expansive AI analysis across different rhythmic experiments for instant results.
- **Standardization Cache:** 100% persistent hash-based reuse.
- **Timeline Continuity:** Zero-gap enforcement via mathematical start/end snapping.

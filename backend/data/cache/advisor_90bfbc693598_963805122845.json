      "Lacks high-energy 'dancing in a crowd' or 'nightclub' style footage to fully hit the 'social gathering' requirement of the reference.",

  "editorial_strategy": "Prioritize 'The Messy Human Moment' over 'The Beautiful Shot.' If a clip is shaky but shows genuine laughter (like clip 15 or 82), it carries 10x the narrative weight of a stable mountain pan. The edit must feel like a private joke that the audience is being let in on.",
  "remake_strategy": "To reach Director's Cut quality, aggressively prune any clip that doesn't feature a person's face or a shared group action. Replace the 'scenic' transitions (clip 45, 30) with more 'POV from the car' or 'running with the camera' shots to maintain the handheld memory-reel momentum.",
